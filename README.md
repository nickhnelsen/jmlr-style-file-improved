Improved LaTeX style file for the Journal of Machine Learning Research.

Notable changes to `jmlr2e.sty` include:

- Add period after last level section number (both in main body and appendix)
- Remove copyright and license if preprint option is enabled

- Add "assumption" and "notation" theorem environments with counters, and "problem" and "Main Theorem" theorem environments with no counters
- Patch cleveref by modifying load order

Notable changes to `sample.tex` include:
- Default to "nohyperref" option
- Load hyperref with custom link colors and pagebackref
- Add sample theorem and proof environments with custom names
- Test cleveref in appendix

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Cross references `\ref{}` to subsection and subsubsections will carry a trailing period, which may be undesirable if these references do not end the current sentence. Some possible improvements to this behavior [may be found here](https://superuser.com/questions/811779/how-to-add-a-dot-for-section-subsection-numbering-in-tex).
